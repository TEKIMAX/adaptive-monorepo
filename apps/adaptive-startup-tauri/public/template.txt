Business Plan Template for a Startup Business

A startup business plan serves several purposes. It can help convince investors or lenders to finance your business, persuade partners or key employees to join your company, and, most importantly, act as a roadmap guiding the launch and growth of your new venture.

Writing a business plan is an opportunity to carefully think through every step of starting your company so you can prepare for success. This is your chance to discover any weaknesses in your business idea, identify opportunities you may not have considered, and plan how you will deal with challenges that are likely to arise. Be honest with yourself as you work through your plan. Don’t gloss over potential problems; instead, figure out solutions.

A good business plan is clear and concise. A person outside of your industry should be able to understand it. Avoid overusing industry jargon or terminology.

Most of the time involved in writing your plan should be spent researching and thinking. Make sure to document your research, including the sources of any information you include.

Avoid making unsubstantiated claims or sweeping statements. Investors, lenders, and others reading your plan will want to see realistic projections and expect your assumptions to be supported with facts.

This template includes instructions for each section of the business plan, followed by corresponding fillable worksheets.

The last section, Refining Your Plan, explains ways you may need to modify your plan for specific purposes, such as obtaining a bank loan, or for specific industries, such as retail.

Proofread your completed plan (or have someone proofread it for you) to ensure it is free of spelling and grammatical errors and that all figures are accurate.

I. Instructions: Executive Summary

The Executive Summary is the most important part of your business plan. Often, it's the only part that a prospective investor or lender reads before deciding whether or not to read the rest of your plan. It should convey your enthusiasm for your business idea and get readers excited about it, too.

Write your Executive Summary LAST, after you have completed the rest of the business plan. That way, you'll have thought through all the elements of your startup and be prepared to summarize them.

The Executive Summary should briefly explain each of the items below.

An overview of your business idea (one or two sentences).
A description of your product and/or service. What problems are you solving for your target customers?
Your goals for the business. Where do you expect the business to be in one year, three years, five years?
Your proposed target market. Who are your ideal customers?
Your competition and what differentiates your business. Who are you up against, and what unique selling proposition will help you succeed?
Your management team and their prior experience. What do they bring to the table that will give your business a competitive edge?
Financial outlook for the business. If you're using the business plan for financing purposes, explain exactly how much money you want, how you will use it, and how that will make your business more profitable.
Limit your Executive Summary to one or two pages in total.

After reading the Executive Summary, readers should have a basic understanding of your business, should be excited about its potential, and should be interested enough to read further.

After you've completed your business plan, come back to this section to write your executive summary on the next page.

Executive Summary

(Write after you've completed the rest of the business plan.)

II. Instructions: Company Description

This section explains the basic elements of your business. Include each of the items below.

1. Company mission statement
A mission statement is a brief explanation of your company's reason for being. It can be as short as a marketing tagline (“MoreDough is an app that helps consumers manage their personal finances in a fun, convenient way.”) or more involved (“Doggie Tales is a dog daycare and grooming salon specializing in convenient services for urban pet lovers. Our mission is to provide service, safety and a family atmosphere, enabling busy dog owners to spend less time taking care of their dog's basic needs and more time having fun with their pet.”) In general, keep your mission statement to one or two sentences.

2. Company philosophy and vision
a. What values does your business live by? Honesty, integrity, fun, innovation, and community are examples.
b. Vision refers to the long‑term outlook for your business. What do you ultimately want it to become? For instance, your vision for a dog‑day‑care center might be to become a national chain, a franchise, or to sell to a larger company.
3. Company goals
Specify your long‑ and short‑term goals as well as any milestones or benchmarks you will use to measure your progress. For example, if one goal is to open a second location, milestones might include reaching a specific sales volume or signing contracts with a certain number of clients in the new market.

4. Target market
You will cover this in depth in the Marketing Plan section. Here, briefly explain who your target customers are.

5. Industry
Describe your industry and what makes your business competitive: Is the industry growing, mature, or stable? What is the industry outlook short‑term and long‑term? How will your business take advantage of projected industry changes and trends? What might happen to your competitors, and how will your business successfully compete?

6. Legal structure
a. Is your business a sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership, or corporation? Why did you choose this particular form?
b. If there is more than one owner, explain how ownership is divided. If you have investors, explain the percentage of shares they own. This information is important to investors and lenders.
After reading the Company Description, the reader should have a basic understanding of your business's mission and vision, goals, target market, competitive landscape, and legal structure.

Use the Company Description worksheet on the next page to help you complete this section.

Product & Service Description Guide

Product & Service Overview

The problem the product or service solves
Every business needs to address a problem that its customers face. Explain what the problem is and how your product or service solves it. Highlight the benefits, key features, and the unique selling proposition. While competitors exist, describe why your solution is superior—whether it targets an underserved customer base, offers a distinctive advantage, or possesses other competitive edges.

Proprietary features that give you a competitive advantage
• Do you hold a patent or have a patent pending?
• Are there exclusive agreements with suppliers or vendors for products/services your competitors don’t offer?
• Do you possess a license for high‑demand, scarce technology or services?

Pricing strategy
• Detail the pricing, fee, subscription, or leasing structure.
• Position your product within the competitive landscape: low‑end, mid‑range, or high‑end?
• Explain how this pricing will attract customers and the projected profit margin.

Include any product or service details—technical specifications, drawings, photos, patent documents, and other supporting information—in the Appendices.

After reading the Products & Services section, the reader should clearly understand what your business does, the problem it solves, and the unique selling proposition that makes it competitive.

10. Pricing

You explained pricing briefly in the “Products & Services” section; now go into more detail. How do you plan to set prices? Keep in mind that few small businesses can compete on price without hurting profit margins. Rather than offering the lowest price, aim for an average price and compete on quality and service.

Does your pricing strategy reflect your positioning?
Compare your prices with your competitors’. Are they higher, lower, or the same? Why?
How important is price to your customers? It may not be a deciding factor.
What will your customer service and credit policies be?

Convenient location for customers
Adequate parking for employees and customers

Direct sales
E‑commerce
Wholesale
Inside sales force

Create two forecasts:

Best‑guess scenario – what you realistically expect.
Worst‑case scenario – the most conservative numbers you can still achieve.
Document the research and assumptions behind each forecast; financing sources will want to know the basis for your numbers.

After reading the Marketing Plan section, the reader should understand who your target customers are, how you plan to market to them, what sales and distribution channels you will use, and how you will position your product/service relative to the competition.

This section gives readers an understanding of the people behind your business, their roles, responsibilities, and prior experience. Investors and lenders heavily assess whether you have a qualified management team.

1. Biographies

Include brief biographies of the owner(s) and key employees. Summarize each person’s experience and skills that prepare them to succeed in this business. Highlight any prior experience starting and growing a business.

2. Gaps

Explain how you will fill gaps in management or experience (e.g., hiring a CFO, retaining an accountant, adding an in‑house sales manager, or using outside sales reps).

Use the Management Worksheet and Organization Chart on the next pages to highlight your management team.

Startup Expenses & Capitalization

Detail the expenses required to open your business and the capital needed. Do not include ongoing expenses after the business opens; those belong in the Financial Plan.

1. Start‑Up Expenses

Download and complete the Start‑Up Expenses template. Explain the assumptions behind each figure, sources of any secured or expected loans (amounts and terms), and investor contributions (ownership percentages). Include a reserve for contingencies—typically 20 %–25 % of total start‑up costs.

2. Opening Day Balance Sheet

Download and complete the opening‑day balance‑sheet template. Explain the assumptions behind the projected figures.

3. Personal Financial Statement

Provide a personal financial statement for each principal owner to demonstrate personal financial capacity.

If you are using the business plan to seek financing, include personal financial statements for each owner and each major stockholder. The personal financial statements should detail each person's assets and liabilities outside of the business and their personal net worth. Investors and/or lenders typically expect business owners to use personal assets to finance a startup, and they'll want to see how much capital you have available from your personal finances.

After reading the Startup Expenses & Capitalization section, the reader should know how much money is needed to start the business and how well capitalized you are.

VIII. Instructions: Financial Plan

Your financial plan is perhaps the most important element of your business plan. Lenders and investors will review it in detail. Developing your financial plan helps you set financial goals for your startup and assess its financing needs. Include the following:

1. 12‑month profit & loss projection
Also known as an income statement or P&L, the 12‑month profit and loss projection is the centerpiece of your business plan. Download the 12‑Month Profit and Loss Projection and fill in your projected sales, cost of goods sold, and gross profit (refer to the Sales Forecast you created in Section IV). Then list your expenses, net profit before taxes, estimated taxes, and net operating income.

Be sure to explain the assumptions behind the numbers in your P&L. Keep detailed notes about how you arrived at these figures; you may need this information to answer questions from potential financing sources.

2. Optional: 3‑year profit & loss projection
A three‑year profit and loss projection is not essential, but you may want to create one if you expect your business's financials to change substantially after the first year, or if investors or lenders require it. Download the 3‑Year Profit and Loss Projection template and use it to create your projection.

3. Cash flow projection
The cash flow statement tracks how much cash your business has on hand at any given time. For now, create a cash flow projection as a forecast for your business checking account. It details when you need to spend money on items such as inventory, rent, and payroll, and when you expect to receive payments from customers and clients. For example, you may make a sale, have to buy inventory to fulfill the sale, and not collect payment from the customer for 30, 60, or 90 days. The projection helps you budget for upcoming expenses so your business doesn’t run out of money.

Download the 12‑Month Cash Flow Statement and use it to create your projections.

4. Optional: 3‑year cash flow statement
Depending on your needs and the purpose of your business plan, you may also want to include a 3‑year cash flow statement. If so, download the 3‑Year Cash Flow Statement and use it to create your projections. This document is simpler than the 12‑month cash flow statement but can still be useful in planning.

5. Projected balance sheet
A balance sheet subtracts the company's liabilities from its assets to arrive at the owner's equity. You already created an opening‑day balance sheet in Section 1. Now download the Balance Sheet (Projected) and create a projected balance sheet showing the estimated financial condition of your business at the end of its first year. The projected balance sheet includes any owner’s equity resulting from the business's first year in operation, which lenders and investors may want to see.

6. Break‑even calculation
The break‑even analysis projects the sales volume needed to cover your costs. Download the Break‑Even Analysis template, and using your profit and loss projections, enter your expected fixed and variable costs. Adjust the categories to reflect your own business.

You can create multiple break‑even scenarios—for example, comparing payroll costs for full‑time employees versus independent contractors—to determine the best option.

7. Use of capital
If you’re using the business plan to seek financing from lenders or investors, provide a breakdown of how you will use the capital and what results you expect. For example, you might allocate funds to purchase new equipment that will double production capacity.

After reading the Financial Plan section, the reader should understand the assumptions behind your financial projections and be able to judge whether these projections are realistic.

A SCORE mentor can help you complete your Financial Plan tailored for your business. Find a SCORE mentor.

IX. Instructions: Appendices

Don’t slow your readers down by cluttering your business plan with supporting documents, such as contracts or licenses. Instead, place these documents in the Appendices and refer to them in the body of the plan so readers can find them if needed.

Below are some elements many business owners include in their Appendices.

Agreements (leases, contracts, purchase orders, letters of intent, etc.)
Intellectual property (trademarks, licenses, patents, etc.)
Resumes of owners/key employees
Advertising/marketing materials
Public relations/publicity
Blueprints/plans
List of equipment
Market research studies
List of assets that can be used as collateral
You can also include any other materials that will give readers a fuller picture of your business or support the projections and assumptions you make in your plan. For instance, you might want to include photos of your proposed location, illustrations or photos of a product you are patenting, or charts showing the projected growth of your market.

After reviewing the Appendices, the reader should feel satisfied that the assumptions throughout the plan are backed up by documentation and evidence.

X. Instructions: Refining the Plan

Modify your business plan for your specific needs, audience, and industry. Here are some guidelines to help:

For Raising Capital from Bankers
Bankers want to know that you’ll be able to repay the loan. If the plan is for bankers or other lenders, include:

How much money you’re seeking

How that will make your business stronger
Requested repayment terms (number of years to repay)
Any collateral you have and a list of all existing liens against your collateral

Estimated return on investment
Exit strategy for investors (buyback, sale, or IPO)

What are your customer service policies?
How will you handle returns and exchanges?
Will your retail store also have an e‑commerce site, or is one planned for the future?
For an E‑Commerce Business

Will you sell a physical product, a service, a digital product (such as eBooks), or a combination of these?

If you're selling physical products, how will you brand and package them?
