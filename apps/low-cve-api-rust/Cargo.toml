# Worker crate is NOT needed for the container binary itself, but maybe for the worker that controls it?
# Actually, the user's setup implies the container runs the Rust binary, and the Worker interacts with it.
# The binary inside the container is standard Linux binary.
# So we DO NOT need worker-rs in the Cargo.toml for the axum binary.

# Remove Axum/Tokio full features as we switch to worker-rs runtime
