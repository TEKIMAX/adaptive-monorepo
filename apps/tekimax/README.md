# 🦅 Sovereign Engine: AI Trust & Provenance Mono-Repo

The **Sovereign Engine** is an industrial-grade framework for deploying "Verified AI" systems. It combines high-performance LLM orchestration with a robust cryptographic trust layer based on the **C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)** standard.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

This mono-repo comprises three core service layers and a demonstration suite:

| Component | Description | Technology | Port |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Server** | High-performance inference router and C2PA manifest builder. | Rust (Axum) | `3000` |
| **Sovereign CA** | Private Certificate Authority for C2PA signing. | Rust + CFSSL | `11440` |
| **Sovereign Guard** | Security-hardened model node with PII filtering. | Docker + Ollama | `11435` |
| **Neuro Demo** | Real-time frontend showing verified provenance. | Vanilla JS/CSS | `N/A` |

## 🔐 Key Features

### 1. Cryptographic Provenance (C2PA)
Every AI response is injected with an `X-C2PA-Manifest` header. This binary manifest contains:
- **Assertion of Origin**: Proof that the content was generated by a specific Sovereign Engine instance.
- **Visual Seal**: The **Tekimax Logomark** is embedded into the manifest bitstream.
- **Audit Chain**: A link back to the Sovereign CA which issued the signing credentials.

### 2. PII Vault & Scrubber
A stateless, zero-memory utility that identifies and redacts sensitive data (Email, SSN, Phone) before it reaches the LLM. It supports optional AES-256-GCM encryption for "Vaulting" PII.

### 3. Identity Provisioning
Integrated `secure_onboarding` flow that issues unique `project_id` and `api_key` credentials for granular tracking of engine usage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Rust (Stable)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`)

### Local Deployment
1. **Initialize the Trust Layer**:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/sovereign-ca
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Launch the Security Guard**:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/sovereign-guard
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Start the API Server**:
   ```bash
   cd api_server
   cargo run
   ```

4. **Run the Front-end**:
   Open `examples/neuro_demo/index.html` in any modern browser.

## 🌐 Cloudflare Tunneling
The engine is configured for seamless deployment via Cloudflare Tunnels (zrok/ngrok compatible). The CORS policy explicitly exposes the `X-C2PA-Manifest` header to allow client-side verification to function through edge tunnels.

## 🛠 Project Structure
- `/api_server`: Main Rust backend services.
- `/infrastructure`: Dockerized CA and Security Guard environments.
- `/examples`: Frontend demonstration and SDK usage.
- `/ollama_proxy`: Experimental model routing logic.
