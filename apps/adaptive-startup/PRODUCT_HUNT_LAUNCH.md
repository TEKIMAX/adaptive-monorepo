## **First Comment**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm seeking to solve the biggest problem I faced as a founder: **Chaos.**

We all start with a million ideas and scattered docs.
*   "Is this market big enough?"
*   "How do I split equity?"
*   "What belongs in my pitch deck?"

I built **Adaptive Startup** to be the strategic co-pilot I wished I had.

**Key Features:**
*   📊 **AI Market Research:** Get TAM/SAM/SOM instantly.
*   📝 **Lean Canvas 2.0:** Auto-generate business models.
*   🤝 **Team & Equity:** Manage vesting & SAFE agreements.
*   📈 **Financials:** Simple revenue modeling.

**🎁 Special Deal:**
**1 Month FREE** of Adaptive Startup Pro!
Use code: **PILLAROS-FREE**

I'd love to hear your feedback. Let's build something great. 🚀
